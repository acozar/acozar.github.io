	<h3>- A customizable Homepage -</h3>
</div>
<div class="">
<p>Openboard is a simple, customizable home page for your browser.</p>

<p>It has been developed to meet my own needs, but can be freely adapted by modifying just a few lines of code. It has some practical applications such as a plain text editor, as well as a small set of widgets (location, weather, stopwatch, timer, calculator, task list, RSS headlines, etc ...).</p><br>

<p>Openboard applications are developed with <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. Widgets sortable function is done using <a href="https://jqueryui.com/">jQuery-UI</a>.</p><br>

<p>All aspects of the design are developed in CSS, using the <a href="https://acozar.github.io/bcncss/">BarcelonaCSS</a> library, including the four design modes that can be accessed by the lower right button (light, dark, warm and cold).</p><br>

<p>The text editor allows you to load and save text files in simple formats, such as .txt and .md. It also has a word and character counter.</p><br>

<p>The task list works with Cookies that allow the data to be stored in the browser's cache.</p><br>

<p>The widgets provided by the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/widgets">Coingecko</a> and <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/widget/">Tradingview</a> platforms have been used for the cryptocurrency and stock quotes widgets.</p><br>

<p>Soon, I will implement the use of Cookies to obtain a persistent behavior for widgets and design modes.</p><br>
